    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is popular for its simple and relatively straightforward syntax. Its syntax readability increases productivity as it allows us to focus more on the problem rather than structuring the code."

    "### Simple and easy to learn\n",
    "Python has a very simple and elegant syntax. It is much easier to read and write programs in Python compared to other languages like C, C++, or Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to this reason, many beginners are introduced to programming with Python as their first programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Free and open-source\n",
    "You can freely use and distribute Python programs even for commercial use. As it is open-source, you can even change Python's source code to fit your use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Portability\n",
    "A single Python program can run on different platforms without any change in source code. It runs on almost all platforms including Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "### High-Level Interpreted Language\n",
    "Python itself handles tasks like memory management and garbage collection. So unlike C or C++, you don't have to worry about system architecture or any other lower-level operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rich library and large community\n",
    "Python has numerous reliable built-in libraries. Python programmers have developed tons of free and open-source libraries, so you don't have to code everything by yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python community is very large and evergrowing. If you encounter errors while programming in Python, it's like that it has already been asked and solved by someone in this community."

    "4. **Audio or Video based Applications** \n",
    "    - Python is awesome to perform multiple tasks and can be used to develop multimedia applications. Some of real applications are: TimPlayer, cplay etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Enterprise Applications** \n",
    "    - Python can be used to create applications which can be used within an Enterprise or an Organization. Some real time applications are: OpenErp, Tryton, Picalo etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Applications for Images** \n",
    "    - Using Python several application can be developed for image. Applications developed are: VPython, Gogh, imgSeek etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Games and 3D Graphics** \n",
    "    - PyGame, PyKyra are two frameworks for game-development with Python. Apart from these, we also get a variety of 3D-rendering libraries. If youâ€™re one of those game-developers, you can check out PyWeek, a semi-annual game programming contest."
