Introduction\\nThe world has recognized a strong need to transition to renewable energy sources in\\nplace of formerly destructive forms of energy [1,2]. There are other problems that have\\narisen because of the use of these energy sources, such as climate change and energy\\nshortages as well as political instability [3]. Solar energy is gaining increasing interest since\\nit can be directly converted to electricity and used to generate electricity in addition to being\\nfree, inﬁnite, and environmentally friendly without the use of nonrenewable resources [4].\\nAs a result, solar-based energy systems are commonly used to generate electricity via\\nhuge photovoltaic (PV) modules. However, the photovoltaic facility is frequently exposed\\nto a severe climate and frequently succumbs to rundown conditions when confronted\\nwith strong winds or a major hurricane. This suggests that the conversion efﬁciency of\\nphotovoltaic systems can be signiﬁcantly altered. This raises the possibility that solar\\nsystems’ efﬁciency of conversion may drastically deteriorate.\\nAs a result, it is vital to monitor the real-world performance of PV modules by taking\\ncurrent–voltage readings during operation. A mathematical model and parameter iden-\\ntiﬁcation are usually required to model PV systems. The single diode (SDM) and double\\ndiode (DDM) models are the most popular and commonly used [5]. However, real PV\\nmodel behavior is heavily reliant on parameters that are not known in advance, which can\\nbe unpredictable due to hardware maturation, failure, and unsteady operating conditions.\\nSensors 2022, 22, 8281. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22218281\\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\\n', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Hp\\\\Desktop\\\\NLP_Sessions\\\\class2\\\\sensors-22-08281-v3.pdf', 'file_path': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Hp\\\\Desktop\\\\NLP_Sessions\\\\class2\\\\sensors-22-08281-v3.pdf', 'page': 0, 'total_pages': 28, 'format': 'PDF 1.7', 'title': 'Multi-Strategy Learning Boosted Colony Predation Algorithm for Photovoltaic Model Parameter Identification', 'author': 'Mingjing Wang, Long Chen and Huiling Chen', 'subject': \"Modeling solar systems necessitates the effective identification of unknown and variable photovoltaic parameters.

The Newton–Raphson\\nmethods [7], tabular methods [8], and iterative cure ﬁtting [9] are examples of deterministic\\nstrategies and additional computational conditions, such as convexity, composability,\\nand differentiability of the selection space, are usually required. This sort of algorithm may\\nnot be able to handle this nonlinear and multimodal complicated problem. Additionally,\\nthey are vulnerable to the features of the beginning solution, which may have an impact on\\ntheir efﬁciency. It is important to note that metaheuristic algorithms have recently received\\nmore attention [6,10]. For a variety of reasons, metaheuristic algorithms are getting a lot\\nof interest. Algorithms like this one can solve problems in a black box without relying\\non task speciﬁcations or incidental data limits such as convexity or the distinctability\\nof different option spaces [11,12]. Stochasticity allows this algorithm to conduct high\\nprobability leaps out of the stalemate, unlike deterministic techniques [13,14]. If a sufﬁcient\\nbalance between exploration and exploitation can be ensured, they can also achieve high\\nquality arrangements with a reasonably rapid and effective search [15]. Because these\\nmetaheuristic algorithms have the potential to be applied in a variety of domains such as\\nmachine learning [16], multi-threshold image segmentation [17], engineering design [18],\\nand medical diagnosis [19].\\nOptimization is a vital step in order to reduce or maximize criteria while also satisfying\\nthe requirements or limitations of the decision-maker [20]. For global optimization prob-\\nlems [21,22], metaheuristic algorithms offer a great deal of potential [23,24]. Metaheuristic\\nalgorithms have been used in many scenarios, medical diagnoses [16,25–28], picture engi-\\nneering [29–31], and engineering applications [32–34]. As a result, metaheuristic algorithms\\nand their modiﬁcations have been widely used to evaluate the parameters of PV. ELPSO\\nwith particle swarm optimization was invented by Jordehi et al. [35]. The RTC France\\nsilicon cell, STM6-40/36 monocrystalline module, and PVM 752 GaAs thin ﬁlm cell are\\nall examples of this working successfully in solar systems. Classiﬁed perturbation muta-\\ntion particle swarm optimization (CPMPSO) was used to identify alternative PV model\\nparameters by Liang et al. [36]. A time-varying acceleration coefﬁcient PSO (TVACPSO)\\nwas developed by Jordehi et al. [37] for this estimate problem, and the TVACPSO might\\noutperform other rivals. Askarzadeh et al. [38] used artiﬁcial bee colony (ABC) factors to\\nidentify evidence of solar cell models. For the parameter extraction of a solar cell, genetic\\nalgorithms (GAs) were also given, and a conclusion was reached that GAs can handle this\\ntask better [39]. To properly identify solar PV module parameters, a penalty-based different\\nevolution algorithm [40] was developed. Experiments have shown that the suggested\\ncomputation is capable of extracting the parameters of solar-powered cell models using\\nan adaptive version of DE [41]. For parameter estimation of solar photovoltaic models,\\nadditionally, Gao and his colleagues [42] utilized a parallel co-evolutionary DE [43] as well\\nas a variant DE. An effective method for identifying unknown photovoltaic model pa-\\nrameters was reported by Chen et al. [22] based on chaotic drifts in close proximity to\\nthe best agent and an opposition-based exploratory approach. Abbassi et al. [44] used an\\nopposition-based learning modiﬁed salp swarm method (OLMSSA) to accurately iden-\\ntify the electrical equivalent circuit characteristics of the PV cell/two module’s diodes.\\nFor a more stable model and a more accurate estimation of the single diode PV model’s\\nparameters, Ridha et al. [45] created a new HHO (BHHO) by combining random evo-\\nlutionary stages from ﬂower pollination algorithms with a powerful mutation strategy\\nfrom DE with 2-Opt algorithms. For the detection of photovoltaic module parameters,\\nZhang et al. [46] presented an improved moth ﬂame technique using an orthogonal learn-\\ning approach.

For the solar\\ncell system model, Fan et al. [49] suggested a unique DDSFLA method with a delayed\\ndynamic step mechanism. By combining a gradient search method with an escape operator,\\nZhou and colleagues [50] came up with an improved gradient-based optimizer (RLGBO)\\nfor photovoltaic model parameter identiﬁcation. In order to ﬁnd unknown parameters\\nin photovoltaic models, this novel technique (LCNMSE) combines Laplace’s cross-search\\nmechanism with the Nelder–Mead simplex method [51]. In order to effectively and reli-\\nably estimate the unknown parameters of the photovoltaic model, according to Liu and\\ncolleagues, an enhanced slime mold algorithm that combines the Nelder–Mead simplex\\napproach with the chaotic map has been proposed [52].\\nTeaching learning-based optimization (TLBO) was given by Patel et al. [53] for the\\nextraction of solar cell parameters, and simulation results have proved its effectiveness\\non this topic. A hybrid of a TLBO and a DE for ﬁnding the parameters of a photovoltaic\\nmodel has been tested and found to be effective [54]. Five parameters are extracted and the\\nimplicit voltage and current equations are solved concurrently, although only one diode\\nRsh-model is considered [55]. When it comes to ﬁnding the parameters of solar cells, Chen\\nand his colleagues [56] have shown that the sine–cosine approach (SCA) with neighboring\\npanels is an appropriate device. For this topic, Abdel-Basset et al. [57] developed an\\nenhanced marine predators algorithm. Wang et al. [6] designed an ensemble multi-strategy\\nframework by using shufﬂed frog-leading algorithms for this issue successfully.\\nHowever, we should keep in mind that despite the core ideal of the “no free lunch\\ntheory” (NFL) [58], metaheuristics cannot reject the beneﬁts of deterministic parameter esti-\\nmation techniques in terms of various factors that merit our attention. In the previous work,\\nthere is relatively little research on the PV parameters of single-crystal and double-crystal\\ndiodes at the same time. In addition, the research on the robustness of equipment exposed\\nto a high voltage or harsh temperature is relatively insufﬁcient. Alternatively, they may\\nstill be stuck in a state of search stagnation known as premature convergence; this problem\\nis shown in current implementations of metaheuristics for PV cell parameter estimation by\\na relatively large value of root mean square error. Furthermore, the performance of some\\nmetaheuristic methods is dependent on predetermined parameters that must be appro-\\npriately set by users, leading to a high risk of stagnation and a weakening of their ability,\\nwhich means that the majority of metaheuristic strategies can be added to extra special\\noperators for various characteristics of complex and changeable problems. Furthermore,\\ncertain metaheuristic algorithm efﬁcacies are reliant on user-deﬁned parameters, which\\nincrease the possibility of stagnation and deterioration and some improvement room may\\nstill exist among some algorithms for this multimodal and nonlinear optimization problem.\\nThis study’s objective work on PV parameter recognition proof has the additional feature of\\nbeing nonlinear and multimodal with several neighboring valleys, making it more difﬁcult\\nthan other typical challenges. Stagnation is also more likely, posing a difﬁcult dilemma\\nfor traditional approaches. Thus, it is necessary that developing an efﬁcient and notable\\noptimization technique for PV parameters estimation is still a problem worth studying.\\nThe colony predation algorithm (CPA) was designed by Tu et al. [59]. CPA employs\\na mathematical mapping strategy similar to that of animal hunting parties, which in-\\ncludes distributing prey, surrounding prey, assisting the most probable successful hunter,\\nand pursuing another target. To our knowledge, no study has used this approach to ad-\\ndress photovoltaic model identiﬁcation, although CPA has been applied to some practical\\ncases [19]. In addition, the CPA’s property is not further investigated, and just a preliminary\\napplication of its original form is used for the issue. Therefore, this study will use CPA in\\nthis research to identify the optimal PV settings across multi-strategy learning mechanisms.\\nTo further enhance the CPA’s capability for dealing with these issues, opposition-\\nbased learning and level-based learning are synchronously integrated into the original\\nCPA, dubbed MLCPA, and they will be utilized to tackle PV parameter identiﬁcation\\nissues.

Solar Cell\\n2.1.1. SDM\\nThe single diode model (SDM) is widely used to represent and realize the solar cell’s\\nfeatures. Using particular parts, the SDM model may be built. First, a current source\\nis connected to a diode. Another resistor signiﬁes the leakage current. Finally, a series\\nresistor compensates for load current losses. The current of the SDM can be calculated\\nby IL = Ipht −Id −Ish where IL stands for the ultimate output current, Ipht is the photo-\\ngenerated current, Id is the diode current estimated by Id = Isd ·\\nh\\nexp\\n\\x10 q·(VL+RS·IL)\\nn·k·T\\n\\x11\\n−1\\ni\\n,\\nand Ish is the shunt resistor current calculated by Ish = VL+RS·IL\\nRsh\\n.

The Proposed CPA-Based Method\\n3.1. Summary of CPA\\nThe colony predation algorithm was designed by Tu et al. [59] who employ a mathemat-\\nical mapping strategy similar to that of animal hunting parties, which includes distributing\\nprey, surrounding prey, assisting the most probable successful hunter, and pursuing another\\ntarget. Individual cooperative communication and food-seeking behavior are represented\\nby the following formulas:\\n⃗\\nXi\\nj(t + 1) = r · ⃗\\nXi1\\nj (t) + (1 −r) ·\\n\\x10\\x10\\n⃗\\nX1(t) + ⃗\\nX2(t)\\n\\x11\\n/2\\n\\x11\\n(7)\\nwhere r is a random value in [0, 1], ⃗\\nXi1\\nj (t) is the target prey, and ⃗\\nX1 and ⃗\\nX2 are two\\nindividuals closed to the ⃗\\nXi1\\nj (t), j ∈1, 2, . . ., dim. ⃗\\nXi\\nj(t + 1) is the latest update position. The\\npredation strategy is realized as ⃗\\nX(t + 1) = ⃗\\nXbest −S · (r1(ub −lb) + lb), where ⃗\\nX(t + 1)\\nis the new individual at the (t + 1)th iterations, ⃗\\nXbest is the position of the food. S is the\\nstrength of prey and and its absolute value decreases with the number of assessments from\\na to 0, r1 is the\\n\\x02\\nR1; R2; R3; . . . Rj\\n\\x03\\n, j = dim represents the dimension of the population, ub,\\nand lb represent the upper and lower bounds. S is calculated by S = 2 · S0 · r2 −S0 and\\nS0 = a −t ·\\n\\x00 a\\nN\\n\\x01\\n, where N is the number of individuals, S0 reduces in value from a to 0,\\nand t denotes the current number of evaluations and r2 is a random value in [0, 1].\\nThe hunting party will encircle the lone target and continue to approach it. This step\\nmay be mathematically described as follows:\\n⃗\\nX(t + 1) = ⃗\\nXbest −2 · S · D · el · tan\\n\\x10\\nl · π\\n4\\n\\x11\\n(8)\\nwhere D means the distance between the current individual and the prey D. The following\\nmathematical formulas represent the odds of applying these two predatory strategies:\\n⃗\\nX(t + 1) =\\n(\\n⃗\\nXbest −S · (r1 · (ub −lb) + lb)r2 ≥0.5\\n⃗\\nXbest −2 · S · D · el · tan\\n\\x00l · π\\n4\\n\\x01\\nr2 < 0.5\\n(9)\\nBecause the group may encounter difﬁculties when hunting monsters, the nearest\\nindividual seeks peer assistance. it can be expressed as ⃗\\nX(t + 1) = ⃗\\nPnearest , where the\\nclosest predator in the support group is indicated by ⃗\\nPnearest nearest. ⃗\\nP is the predator close\\nto the prey. The search for the food can be:\\nD1 = abs\\n\\x10\\n2 · r4 · ⃗\\nXrand −⃗\\nX(t)\\n\\x11\\n⃗\\nX(t + 1) = ⃗\\nXrand −S · D1\\n(10)\\nwhere D1 is the distance traveled by a random group, r4 is generated randomly in [0, 1],\\nand ⃗\\nXrand is a random new individual.

The opposite value of a number X ∈[Lb, lu] is calculated by ¯\\nX = ub + lb −X, and lb\\nand ub are the lowest and higher limits of the search space.

There are no changes that can be made if f (Xi) continues\\nto be superior to f ( ¯\\nXi).\\n3.2.2. Level-Based Learning\\nDuring the evolution process, individuals are often in a variety of distinct evolution\\nstates, each with a unique capability for exploring and exploiting the search space they\\nare in. For the purpose of distinguishing between them, we ﬁrst divide individuals into\\ndistinct levels based on their ﬁtness ratings. To be speciﬁc, the number of N individuals\\ncan be divided into NL levels (L1, L2, · · · , LNL) regarding their ﬁtness. Then, in such levels,\\nbetter individuals are assigned to higher levels, with a lower level index corresponding to a\\ngreater degree of quality. As a result, the highest level is L1, and the lowest level is LNL. In\\nthis study, the same number of individuals in each level is adopted, which is calculated by\\nLs = N/NL. In other words, individuals at a higher level often contain more advantageous\\ninformation that may be used to drive the population toward the global optimal location.\\nAs a result, individuals at higher levels should direct those at lower levels to explore the\\nwhole solution space, allowing for rapid convergence and the discovery of interesting\\nplaces. On the other hand, we observe individuals at various higher levels and discover\\nthat the higher the level to which an individual belongs, the more probable it is that the\\nindividual is near to the global optimal region. That is, individuals at various levels have\\nvarying degrees of exploitation strength. Similarly, individuals at various levels exhibit\\nvarying degrees of exploratory intensity. In other words, individuals with more exploitation\\npotential often have less exploration potential, and vice versa. As a result, an individual\\nat a lower level should learn from those at higher levels how to strike a balance between\\nexploration and exploitation. The details of this idea can be seen in Figure 1. As seen in\\nthis picture, individuals at lower levels may possibly learn from particles at higher levels,\\nand the number of possible exemplars for individuals at various levels varies. Speciﬁcally,\\nwhen an individual’s level increases, it has fewer individuals at higher levels to learn\\nfrom, which corresponds to the hypothesis that better individuals should engage in more\\nexploitation than exploration. In general, this level-based learning may push individuals at\\nlower levels to explore more and individuals at higher levels to exploit more.\\nDividing\\nL1\\nL2\\nL3\\nL4\\nL1\\nL2\\nL3\\nL4\\nPopulation\\nL2 learning \\nL1 learning \\nL4 learning \\nFigure 1.

Numerical Results\\nAn in-depth evaluation of the MLCPA method was carried out via three separate\\ntrials in this study. To begin, some benchmarks were performed to measure whether the\\nMLCPA’s property with the multi-strategy learning operators was signiﬁcantly better than\\nthat of the traditional CPA. There are seven unimodal tasks (F1–F7), six multimodal tasks\\n(F8–F13), and ten different ﬁxed-dimension multimodal tasks (F14–F23). Unlike unimodal\\ntasks, which only have a single global ideal, multimodal and ﬁxed-dimension multimodal\\ntasks often have more than one local optimal value for assessing the exploratory attribute.\\nIn addition, MLCPA was compared to other current algorithms, including one variant of\\nCPA, ECPA [19], the original CPA, BA [61], PSO [62], FA [63], and GSA [64] to further assess\\nits performance, and the parameters of these algorithms are shown in Table 1.\\nTable 1.

Results on Benchmarks\\nIn this part, we compare the proposed MLCPA against other state-of-the-art ap-\\nproaches, including the original CPA, ECPA, BA, PSO, FA, and GSA. There are seven\\nunimodal tasks (F1–F7), six multimodal tasks (F8–F13), and ten different ﬁxed-dimension\\nmultimodal tasks (F14–F23). Table 3 summarizes the average outcomes (Avg), standard de-\\nviation (STD), and rank for dealing with F1–F23, with the average results of 30 independent\\nexecutions and the bold one means that current algorithm has the best function value. It can\\nbe observed from this table that the proposed MLCPA can perform the best mean values\\namong all these competitive algorithms on most benchmarks. Regarding the unimodal\\nbenchmarks, MLCPA demonstrates the best mean values as well as the standard deviation\\n(STD) among these comparison algorithms, indicating that MLCPA can effectively solve the\\noptimization problem with a single global optimum and that the multi-strategy learning\\noperators can obviously improve the original CPA on unimodal tasks. Although MLCPA\\nand ECPA may perform similarly on multimodal benchmarks, MLCPA continues to out-\\nperform all other algorithms on multimodal benchmarks. In terms of ﬁxed-dimension\\nmultimodal tasks, the proposed MLCPA has a clear advantage over previous multimodal\\nbenchmark algorithms.\\nIn addition, the Friedman rank test is also recorded in Table 4;\\nit can be seen that the proposed MLCPA has the best rank, and the ECPA has the second\\nrank. Based on the above experimental statistics, a preliminary conclusion can be drawn\\nthat the performance of the algorithm proposed MLCPA in this paper has a signiﬁcant\\nimprovement over the performance of the original CPA. The underlying reason behind this\\nexperimental phenomenon may be that the new fusion operator proposed has signiﬁcantly\\nimproved the search performance of the algorithm, and can achieve a relatively good\\nbalance between intensiﬁcation and diversiﬁcation.\\nIn order to further verify the property of the MLCPA, Table 3 displays the p-values\\nof MLCPA and other techniques on F1–F23. This table demonstrates that the majority of\\np-values are less than 0.05, indicating that MLCPA has vastly superior properties to the\\noriginal CPA, despite the fact that MLCPA may perform poorly under certain conditions.\\nThe MLCPA has the potential to estimate solar photovoltaic parameters due to its superior\\nperformance in a variety of complex optimization problems involving multiple peaks.\\n', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Hp\\\\Desktop\\\\NLP_Sessions\\\\class2\\\\sensors-22-08281-v3.pdf', 'file_path': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Hp\\\\Desktop\\\\NLP_Sessions\\\\class2\\\\sensors-22-08281-v3.pdf', 'page': 9, 'total_pages': 28, 'format': 'PDF 1.7', 'title': 'Multi-Strategy Learning Boosted Colony Predation Algorithm for Photovoltaic Model Parameter Identification', 'author': 'Mingjing Wang, Long Chen and Huiling Chen', 'subject': \"Modeling solar systems necessitates the effective identification of unknown and variable photovoltaic parameters.

Results of Solar Cell\\n4.2.1. Results on SDM\\nFigure 2 depicts the I-V and P-V ﬁtting diagram of MLCPA for SDM. As noted, the I-V\\nand P-V curves obtained from the model correspond well with experimental data over\\nthe whole voltage range. The error-index values for the computed electric current and\\nthe simulation test for this model are shown in IAE and RE values in Figure 3. It was\\ndetermined to be less than 9.41557237E-03, and all RE values were between −5.668575E-02\\nand 1.368383E+00, indicating that the MLCPA is capable of substantially identifying the\\nreal attribute of SDM. Additionally, according to Table 5, there was an absolute individual\\nerror of 0.1058408 in this case, with a total of 0.0413232 inaccuracy between the trial and\\nobtained data. These critical parameters in SDM can be clearly identiﬁed, and the provided\\ntechnique MLCPA can also be completely supported on this topic.\\nTable 6 summarizes the results of 30 separate runs utilizing MLCPA and other compet-\\ning algorithms. As can be seen, the MLCPA proposal has the lowest RMSE values among all\\ncomparator sets, indicating that its viability proﬁle is more reliable and consistent than the\\nother algorithms. Using statistical veriﬁcation data, a signiﬁcant performance gap between\\nthe proposed CPA-based algorithm and competing algorithms has been demonstrated. A\\n95% certainty level was used to estimate the conﬁdence ranges for the parameter gauges,\\nas shown in Table 7. It is apparent that MLCPA’s conﬁdence interval has the best dispersion\\nof any competitor method, indicating that it can successfully disentangle parameters in\\nrelatively accurate intermediate intervals.\\n', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Hp\\\\Desktop\\\\NLP_Sessions\\\\class2\\\\sensors-22-08281-v3.pdf', 'file_path': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Hp\\\\Desktop\\\\NLP_Sessions\\\\class2\\\\sensors-22-08281-v3.pdf', 'page': 12, 'total_pages': 28, 'format': 'PDF 1.7', 'title': 'Multi-Strategy Learning Boosted Colony Predation Algorithm for Photovoltaic Model Parameter Identification', 'author': 'Mingjing Wang, Long Chen and Huiling Chen', 'subject': \"Modeling solar systems necessitates the effective identification of unknown and variable photovoltaic parameters.

Results on PV Module\\nIn this section, the MLCPA was used to address the issue of parameter estimation for\\nthe PV model example Photo Watt-PWP 201. As shown in Figure 6, across the entire voltage\\nrange, the MLCPA ﬁndings for I-V and P-V characteristics of the genuine data and the\\nimitation records were in excellent agreement with the trial records. Additionally, Figure 7\\nshows the erroneous IAE and RE values. As seen in this ﬁgure, while the upper and lower\\nlimits for RE values were 1.34001E-01 (and −1.17285E-02, respectively), all IAE values were\\nbelow 5.09229E-3. It can be concluded that MLCPA is capable of precisely measuring the\\nreal behavior of PV module modes. Additionally, Table 11 summarizes the IAE’s ﬁndings\\non PV mode, and the totals of these values were 0.06450231 and 0.752103455, respectively.\\nThus, it can be observed that the accuracy of the obtained parameters was adequate and of\\nhigh quality, and the MLCPA’s performance on this issue was effectively conﬁrmed.\\nTable 12 includes the exhaustive results of the MLCPA and several additional com-\\npetitors for the photovoltaic module. As can be shown, the suggested MLCPA method\\nsurpassed its competition with a mean RMSE of 5.123650E-04 and a standard deviation of\\n1.4251600E-06 in this situation. BLPSO and NPSOPC may have had a comparable mean\\nRMSE characteristic, however, EMSFLA ranked second in the ﬁndings and surpassed IJAYA\\nand GOTLBO. In terms of the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, MLCPA greatly outperformed\\nother algorithms in this PV situation, and in addition, the conﬁdence interims for parameter\\ngauges with a degree of certainty of 95 percent are also included in Table 13. Regarding this\\ntable, the MLCPA obtained the lowest dispersion for each parameter, demonstrating that\\nthis idea can properly extract the PV demonstration’s parameters, while SDM and DDM\\nexhibit a similar pattern.\\n', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Hp\\\\Desktop\\\\NLP_Sessions\\\\class2\\\\sensors-22-08281-v3.pdf', 'file_path': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Hp\\\\Desktop\\\\NLP_Sessions\\\\class2\\\\sensors-22-08281-v3.pdf', 'page': 16, 'total_pages': 28, 'format': 'PDF 1.7', 'title': 'Multi-Strategy Learning Boosted Colony Predation Algorithm for Photovoltaic Model Parameter Identification', 'author': 'Mingjing Wang, Long Chen and Huiling Chen', 'subject': \"Modeling solar systems necessitates the effective identification of unknown and variable photovoltaic parameters.

Results of the Manufacturer’s Datasheet\\nIn order to further verify the suggested MLCPA approach, several manufacturer\\ndatasets were used in this part. These datasets included multicrystalline (KC200GT) [60]\\nphotovoltaic samples, monocrystalline (SM55) [70] and thin-ﬁlm (ST40) [71] collected\\nat various temperatures and irradiance levels.\\nThe stability and adaptability of the\\nproposed algorithm MLCPA in a complex environment may be studied effectively by\\nevaluating a solar devices’ capacity to recognize parameters at varying temperatures or\\npressures. In Tables 14–16 , the optimal parameters for the single and double diode models\\nof two solar modules at different levels of irradiance and constant temperature 25 ◦C were\\ndetermined by rigorous testing and statistical analysis. In order to verify the accuracy of\\nthe obtained PV show parameters, the assessed electric current was obtained. The I-V\\ncharacteristics of the two distinct modules are delineated at various levels of irradiance,\\nspeciﬁcally 200 W/m2, 400 W/m2, 600 W/m2, 800 W/m2, and 1000 W/m2, as plotted in\\nFigures 8–10 respectively. To add to this, the ideal calculated parameters for these two PV\\nmodules at various temperatures and a constant level of 1000 W/m2 irradiance are shown\\nin Tables 17–19, as well as experimental and estimated (I-V) characteristics in Figures 11–13.\\nRegarding the SDM, the I-V curves derived from these evaluated ideal parameters\\ncorresponded closely to the observed curves at varying temperatures and irradiance levels.\\nMLCPA is able to guarantee an acceptable RMSE on the ST40, SM55, and KC200GT for SDM.\\nRegarding the DDM module, it can be seen that the estimated results are also consistent\\nwith these datasets at various temperatures and irradiance levels; even in an unfavorable\\nenvironment with severe irradiance or temperature levels, the MLCPA can still guarantee an\\nacceptable RMSE value. On the basis of these results, it can be concluded that the proposed\\nMLCPA can continue to provide a high-quality technique for parameter-recognizable proofs\\nof solar cell modules even when subjected to a somewhat challenging environment, such\\nas high pressure or extremely cold temperatures, and that the robustness of the proposed\\nMLCPA has been successfully veriﬁed.\\n', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Hp\\\\Desktop\\\\NLP_Sessions\\\\class2\\\\sensors-22-08281-v3.pdf', 'file_path': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Hp\\\\Desktop\\\\NLP_Sessions\\\\class2\\\\sensors-22-08281-v3.pdf', 'page': 18, 'total_pages': 28, 'format': 'PDF 1.7', 'title': 'Multi-Strategy Learning Boosted Colony Predation Algorithm for Photovoltaic Model Parameter Identification', 'author': 'Mingjing Wang, Long Chen and Huiling Chen', 'subject': \"Modeling solar systems necessitates the effective identification of unknown and variable photovoltaic parameters.

Discussions\\nTwo learning-based operators were incorporated into the CPA in this work, based\\non CPA and using a multi-strategy learning approach. There was also extensive testing\\non the F1–F23 benchmarks, and the ﬁndings show that MLCPA’s capabilities have been\\nsigniﬁcantly improved as a consequence of these new techniques being implemented. The\\nestimated photovoltaic parameters using SDM, DDM, and PV, and three manufacturer’s\\ndatasheets were also subject to a thorough examination of MLCPA. Because of this, the sug-\\ngested MLCPA algorithm should be taken into consideration for tackling the issue at hand\\nas a viable alternative to the other competing algorithms.\\nAccording to Section 4.1, the suggested MLCPA was tested and compared against\\nnumerous existing competing algorithms on a variety of unimodal, multimodal, and ﬁxed-\\ndimension multimodal benchmarks. When compared to the original CPA, the MLCPA\\nclearly outperformed it. Its properties were greatly enhanced and were superior to other\\nalgorithms. MLCPA was also used to identify parameters in these three interconnected\\nmodules. Observe that the MLCPA can precisely identify the crucial parameters of these\\nissues, which are extremely discordant with recordings of experiments on these tasks\\nthroughout the complete voltage range. In terms of SDM, MLCPA has the best value\\namong peers, with an RMSE of 3.254815E-04, a median RMSE of 3.254810E-04, and a\\nmean RMSE of 5.421563E-04. According to the Wilcoxon test, MLCPA achieved the best\\nDDM results (8.521426E-04 for the minimum RMSE, 8.854789E-04 for the medium RMSE,\\nand 7.652418E-04 for the mean RMSE), beating out the competition’s ﬁndings by a wide\\nmargin. When it comes to PV modules, MLCPA showed the greatest RMSE values and\\nwas far better than other rivals in the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.

More exploitative tendencies in the search for the best solution, as well as a better\\nexploitative ability when combined, can be guaranteed with level-based learning strategy\\nadditions.\\nThis means that, in comparison to other algorithms that can’t beneﬁt from\\nthis characteristic, MLCPA may achieve an important capacity for exploiting. As a result,\\nMLCPA’s primary physiognomies have advanced fundamentally, as shown by numerous\\nfactual statistics.\\nAdditionally, three manufacturers’ datasets were utilized to study the MLCPA’s dura-\\nbility and effectiveness when faced with severe high-pressure or low-temperature condi-\\ntions. In Section 4.3, detailed statistical results are shown clearly. When exposed to high\\ntemperatures such as 75 ◦C or high irradiation levels such as 1000 W/m2, the estimated\\ncurrent value may be determined using the ST40, SM55, and KC200GT data and a pleasing\\nRMSE error was still available, showing that the MLCPA’s stability can be improved over\\ntime due to the introduced feature of multi-strategy learning. As a consequence, MLCPA\\nmay be regarded a potential approach for determining the characteristics of solar cells that\\ndisplay long-term stability in performance. The proposed optimizer MLCPA was not only\\nstudied for this research’s case studies; it may be used in other ﬁelds as well, such as power\\nengineering. In the future, the MLCPA might be used to determine the appropriate settings\\nfor certain challenges. In addition, the research limitations of the algorithm proposed in\\nthis paper must also be noted. Firstly, this paper introduces new operators to the original\\nCPA. As for the execution time of the algorithm, the computational time consumed was\\nsigniﬁcantly higher than that of the original CPA, which is equivalent to sacriﬁcing the\\ncomputational time to replace the efﬁciency. Secondly, this paper only considers the single\\nobjective when designing algorithms, which is not enough for considering the application\\nof robust algorithms. Finally, the dataset used in this study is very limited and open source.\\nIt is ideal to obtain data from real scenarios to verify the performance of the algorithm.\\n6. Conclusions and Future Works\\nIn this paper, multi-strategy learning boosted colony predation algorithm (MLCPA)\\nwith opposition-based learning and level-based learning was used to extract the solar cell\\nmodel parameters and photovoltaic modules. Based on the above experimental results,\\nsome conclusions can be drawn as follows:\\n•\\nOn benchmark results, the conventional CPA’s property can be enhanced through\\nthe unique behavior of opposition-based learning, and a more stable balance be-\\ntween intensiﬁcation and diversiﬁcation can be achieved through the addition of\\nlevel-based learning.\\n•\\nThe results of the experiments show that MLCPA has a clear advantage over its rivals\\nwhen it comes to estimating various PV parameters.\\n•\\nRegarding results at different levels of temperature and irradiation, MLCPA can still\\nperform very well even when it is under a lot of pressure or when the temperature is\\nvery low.\\n•\\nThe MLCPA–based approach may be employed as a viable device for resolving the\\nknowledge of solar cell model parameters and photovoltaic modules, as well as\\nproviding an untapped option for solar energy conversion.\\nThe proposed MLCPA has a few ﬂaws that need to be investigated further in future\\ndevelopments. The propertiese of the MLCPA still have room to improve on, and new\\noperators could be introduced into this MLCPA such as self-adaptive quasi-oppositional\\nstochastic fractal search [72] or an elitism-based framework [73]. It is possible to create\\nthis proposal’s multi-objective variant. The multi-objective may, therefore, be solved\\nby considering not only RMSE minimization but also another goal at the same time,\\nand this multi-objective version may make advantage of additional application situations.\\nSecond, the binary version involving combinatorial optimization should be built while\\nthe real power dispatching management is still working on solving the electric power\\nscheduling issues.
