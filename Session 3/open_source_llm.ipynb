The story follows Jack Torrance, a struggling writer, who takes a job as the winter caretaker of the Overlook Hotel in Colorado. The hotel, which has a dark and violent past, begins to influence Jack's mind, leading him down a path of madness and terror.\n",

Her mother, Chris, seeks the help of two priests to perform an exorcism to save her daughter. The novel is known for its graphic and disturbing depictions of possession and exorcism.\n",
